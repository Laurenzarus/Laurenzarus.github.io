    <h1>Final Project Summary</h1>
    <p>Topic/Purpose: My final project is simply a sort of personal website that describes me: a kind of online resume, essentially. I wanted to create a website that can tell viewers information about me while also being mildly entertaining (AKA not as boring as reading the info off a piece of paper).</p>
    <p>Special Features: I have imported two different Google Fonts into my website, which I use on every single page. I am also using two different jQuery plugins on separate pages. The names of the plugins, along with links to their documentation, are below:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            JQuery Timespace: <a href="https://www.jqueryscript.net/time-clock/Timeline-Slider-jQuery-Timespace.html">https://www.jqueryscript.net/time-clock/Timeline-Slider-jQuery-Timespace.html</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            JQuery skdslider: <a href="https://www.jqueryscript.net/slider/Responsive-Full-Width-Slider-Plugin-For-jQuery-skdslider.html">https://www.jqueryscript.net/slider/Responsive-Full-Width-Slider-Plugin-For-jQuery-skdslider.html</a>
