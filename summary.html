    <h1>Final Project Summary</h1>
    <p>Topic/Purpose: My final project is simply a sort of personal website that describes me: a kind of online resume, essentially. I wanted to create a website that can tell viewers information about me while also being mildly entertaining (AKA not as boring as reading the info off a piece of paper).</p>
    <p>Extra features: I am using Wordpress for the "blog" part of the project, accessible through selecting the "blog" option on the homepage. Additionally, I have used two Bootstrap components on the "contact.html" page, when the user clicks on "Send me a message!". The components are Bootstrap modals and Bootstrap forms</p>
    <p>
        JavaScript Requirement: Disable background image by clicking on fixed div in upper right corner. Additionally, the modal called on the contact.html page uses JavaScript to bring up the modal onclick.
