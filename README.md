The code for my personal website. Currently hosts the project/website I made with my team during USC's Hackathon TrojanHacks Strikes Back 2018.

Planning to implement this page as my final project for ITP 104 - Web Publishing at USC. At that point the homepage will contain a link to the bingo game.
